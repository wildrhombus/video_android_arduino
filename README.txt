This is an android/arduino app that allows an external sensor to stop and start a video
that has been loaded into the sim of the android device.

The arduino controls a switch that sends on and off signals to the app.
The app pauses and restarts the video playback according to the signals received.

It was created for Max Dean for his sculpture Blinky.

It was originally created in Eclipse and currently needs to be upgraded to Android Studio.

The only device that this has been tested on is a Nexus 7.

The arduino code is published in the arduino-btn-android repository.
